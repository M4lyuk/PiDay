# PiDay
Remember as many digits as you can from Pai

This is a simple CLI program I created for Pi Day ( 14 March, or 3.14 ).
This game tests how many digits from Pi does the player knows, and at the end, he gets the score => how many digits he typed right.

## Configure
Before starting the game, the player should type the path of the txt file which contains the Pai.
There's a default text file named "pi.txt", it contains 100,000 digits of Pai ( 3. + 100,000 ).

The player should also type the number of allowed fails ( starting from 1 ). 
If he typed 3, he would be given 3 fails before ending the game and getting the score.

## Requirments 
I coded it in Visual Studio 2022 version, recommend running it there too.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lnir947/PiDay.git
```
